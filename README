This contains two projects - one is the implementation of AutoCamera, an activity that loads, binds to a given service, takes a photo, sends the file name to the service, then exits.  The second is a refernce implemenation containing a service and an control app that starts the service.  When the control app starts the autocameraimplementservice, the autocamera activity is loaded and picture taken, and send back to the service.  This only happens ones per service load, so you have to end the service to take anotyher picutre.  A 'real' service would call autocamera as many times as needed, but this just shows the main mechanics of it.
